# Introduction
This is an introduction section, where you should describe the overall purpose of the API and some of the important concepts and abstractions.

<!-- == RESOURCE GROUP: Fruit and Fruits Collection ======================================================================== -->

# Group Fruit
In my domain model, I am dealing with fruits. I have two distinct resources in that context. The first resource is the `Fruit` resource, which represent a single fruit (a banana, an apple or a kiwi). The second resource the `Fruits Collection` resource, which represents a collection of fruits (in other words, 0, 1 or many fruits).


## Fruit [/fruits/{id}]

A Fruit is something that you can eat and that is delicious. This is just an example to show that in the API documentation, we have a place where we can describe the resource types, which are in essence the elements of our domain models. 


<!-- We can describe parameters and reference them in method calls, later in the document -->

+ Parameters

    + id (number, `1`) ... An identifier that uniquely identifies a `Fruit`.


+ Model (application/json)

    This is the `application/json` message resource representation.

    + Body
    
            {
              "name": "banana",
              "properties": { 
                    "color": "yellow" 
              }
            }


### Retrieve a Fruit [GET]
This method is used to retrieve a `Fruit` resource by specifying its unique id. Note that we reference the resource model in the `Response 200` block.

### Update a Fruit [PUT]

A Fruits Collection is a list of fruits.

    This is the `application/json` message resource representation.

                    "properties": { 
                        "color": "yellow"

                },
                {
                    "name": "apple",
                    "properties": { 
                        "color": "red" 
                    }
                },
                {
                    "name": "orange",
                    "properties": { 
                        "color": "blue" 
                    }
